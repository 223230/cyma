# Cyma

Cyma is a collection of flexible, composable views that you can use to make any
plug-in UI with ease. It uses various custom data structures for real-time
visualizers, allowing you to easily build plug-in UIs that are performant. It
works on top of [VIZIA](https://github.com/vizia/vizia) as a "view library" for
your [nih-plug](https://github.com/robbert-vdh/nih-plug) UIs.

In this book, you'll learn how you can compose some common visualizers - and you
will also learn the basics of how Cyma works along the way.
